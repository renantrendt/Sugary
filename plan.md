SO this app is going to be a tracking app that will track your sguar per day, and ultimatly per week.

The website starts with a home screen where you can login with ur Name tag (name tags cannot repeat)[to save names and to check if nametag already exist SUpabse], there's gonna be an option of Login or create account

**Subase also saves how much sugar every user has**
- And by that i mean add a ranking of the top 3, right below the **Date** a
Once you've created/logged in your account, youll go to a **home** screen.
## Home screen ## (this app is focused on mobile so need tracking if it is Mobile or Computer)

***So this app if focused 100% on mobile so this desing is "supposed to fit it, but i will be testing the app on a computer so maybe trhats a problem?***

- and right below the top right corner. a button syaing "Weekly goals""
- ON the middle a Sugar button
  - right bewlo the sugar button, there's a sugar per day(?) button that has 5g by default, and you can click it to add sugar to your daily thing, you can press it multiple times to add sugar. 
**Weely goals**
- once clicked it a little side bar appears and you can write the total amount of sugar you want to eat per week and once you pressed enter, it calculates the amount per day.
- Also right below it, make a Failed button
    - that once clicked you can write what happens if you fail your goal
        - and then if you do fail the thing/text you wrote in there will appear red for 3 seconds on your screen. Like "No anime for a day" or sm the person chooses


## THe subase saves by insentive key name like if i put Renan and renan is same user, so the date sves like that 




































### Idea for later ###
- Tracking your families sugar somhow, dunno yet tho
- the sugar button keep pressed for 2 seconds and starts going up and icnrease suger g by 1 every second, once released it stops, and adds to the total Sp/day
- remove the sugar if idk you put the wrong amount
- streak of how many day without sugar
